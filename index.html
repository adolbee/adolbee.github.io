        <h2>My Tunisia Internship</h2>
        <h6>October 27th, 2022</h6>
        
        <p>My love for travel and technology <em>coincided</em> once again. I 'd had experience in helping people with just the use of my laptop and love of learning before, but now it had led me to an IT internship in Sousse, Tunisia. I spent one month learning from an amazing team of techies how to code (with no previous experience) a one page website! I loved it. I was so intimidated at first but they showed me what an amazing <strong>community</strong> the tech world is.<br>
<br>
I'm so grateful for that first experience and it's something I'll never forget.</p>
<br>
<h2>California and Coding</h2>
<h6>February 14th, 2023</h6>
<p><em>Fast forward</em> to today. I'm back in California, writing this for a project in the Bay Valley Tech training. I'm hoping to join the Digital Skills bootcamp and further my tech skills and capability to help others. I'm passionate about improving and am grateful for this opportunity that this tech company is providing, not only to me but my <strong>community</strong>.
<br>
<br>

I look forward to what the future holds!
